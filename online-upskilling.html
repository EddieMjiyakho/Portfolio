    <p class="section__text__p2">
  I use <strong>SoloLearn</strong> and <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> as part of my ongoing upskilling journey. 
  SoloLearn is an application on my phone, which makes it incredibly convenient and accessible anywhere, anytime. 
  Instead of spending my free time chatting or watching short videos, I often choose to practice coding directly from my phone. 
  I enjoy how interactive and user-friendly the platform is, and the fact that itâ€™s completely free makes it even better for continuous learning. 
  <br><br>
  I also use <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> because it offers structured and beginner-friendly tutorials, both on its website and YouTube channel. 
  Their YouTube tutorials, with over 1.5 million subscribers and millions of views, are highly recommended by experienced software engineers around the world. 
  The platform provides hands-on coding projects that make learning practical, and its community of over 2 million learners creates a great environment for growth and collaboration. 
  These platforms have helped me build a strong foundation while keeping learning flexible, enjoyable, and consistent.
