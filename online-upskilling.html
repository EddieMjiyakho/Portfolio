  <p class="section__text__p2">
  I use <strong>SoloLearn</strong> on my phone as part of my upskilling routine because it’s convenient and lets me practice coding anywhere. 
  I prefer spending my free time learning instead of scrolling on social media, and I also like that the platform is interactive, user-friendly, and free.
  <br><br>
  I also learn through <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> since it provides structured, beginner-friendly lessons and practical coding projects. 
  I follow both their website and YouTube channel, which are trusted by many experienced engineers. 
  Being part of their large learning community keeps my learning consistent, enjoyable, and flexible.
  <br><br>
  I’m also really interested in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and often use <strong>TryHackMe</strong> for Capture the Flag challenges and real-world security labs. 
  These help me understand vulnerabilities and how defenses work. 
  I also watch cybersecurity tutorials on YouTube to stay updated, which has fueled my curiosity to keep improving and applying what I learn in real-world scenarios.
